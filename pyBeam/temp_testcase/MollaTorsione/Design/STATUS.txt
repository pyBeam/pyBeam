VALIDATIONS


1) & 2) fint_wrt_IN and _WB 

partially validated, in the sense that in the linear case there is no dependence, and numericla linear system solutions cause some numericla instabilities


4) validation_U_wrtWB

validated. Same issues as above.

5) validation-weight 

validated

3) validation KS
Validated KS (and intermediate components) for th linear case, both with and without stiffeners.
To coplete it needs the Nonlineare case, and the validation of KS in which the critical component is the tau and not the sigma boom.
